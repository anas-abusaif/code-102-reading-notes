# loops and operators
1. loops

loops are pretty useful when you want to run  the same code over and over with a different value each time.

Example 1: for

`for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
   code block to be executed
}`

Example 2: while

`while (condition) {
   code block to be executed
}`

 2. operators

JavaScript operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.
